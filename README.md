dockerfile-apache-php
=====================

Docker file for running your php scripts inside apache. The image includes mysql and mod rewrite for your standard needs. If you're looking for MySQL try MariaDB: https://github.com/dockerfile/mariadb


Also, I've included a convenience command to run the apache container. You just need to change where you want to point the data inside /Users/...
